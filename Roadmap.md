Alright, listen up! 💪 You want to **dominate** that Junior Data Engineer role? Here's your battle plan - **18 days** instead of 15 because I'm not letting you half-ass the critical stuff. Your "good learning speed" better be real because this is gonna be **intense**. 🔥

## 🎯 **Days 1-3: SQL Mastery (Core Foundation)**

**Focus: 80% effort on ANSI SQL + Spark SQL**

- **Day 1**: Advanced SQL - Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG/LEAD), CTEs, subqueries
- **Day 2**: Spark SQL syntax differences, partitioning strategies, broadcast joins, optimizations
- **Day 3**: Query optimization, indexing strategies, execution plans - solve **10-15 medium/hard SQL problems** on LeetCode/HackerRank

**Mini Project**: Write 5 complex analytical queries (sales analysis, user retention, time-series aggregations) in both ANSI SQL and Spark SQL

***

## ⚡ **Days 4-7: PySpark Deep Dive (THE Money Skill)**

**Focus: 80% on DataFrames, Transformations, Data Processing**

- **Day 4**: Spark architecture, RDDs vs DataFrames, lazy evaluation, actions vs transformations
- **Day 5**: PySpark DataFrames - select, filter, groupBy, agg, joins (broadcast, shuffle), window functions
- **Day 6**: Data ingestion from CSV/JSON/Parquet, schema inference vs explicit schemas, handling null values
- **Day 7**: UDFs (User Defined Functions), data quality checks, partitioning/bucketing strategies

**Mini Project**: Build an ETL pipeline that reads messy CSV data, cleanses it (handle nulls, duplicates, type conversions), performs aggregations, and writes to Parquet with partitioning

***

## ☁️ **Days 8-11: Azure Cloud Data Services**

**Focus: 80% on Azure Data Factory, Databricks, ADLS Gen2**

**Days 8-9: Azure Data Factory**

- Azure Data Factory architecture - pipelines, activities, linked services, datasets
- Integration Runtimes (Azure IR, Self-hosted IR)
- Data flows, copy activities, and transformations
- ADF triggers, scheduling, and monitoring

**Days 10-11: Azure Databricks + ADLS Gen2**

- ADLS Gen2 storage patterns, mounting in Databricks
- Data lake architecture (raw/processed/curated zones)
- Databricks notebooks, cluster management, Delta Lake basics
- Unity Catalog for data governance

**Mini Project**: Create an Azure Data Factory pipeline that reads data from ADLS Gen2, transforms using PySpark in Databricks, and loads to a Delta table in Azure Synapse or Databricks

***

## 🔄 **Days 12-14: Workflow Orchestration (Airflow Focus)**

**Focus: 80% on DAGs, operators, task dependencies**

- **Day 12**: Airflow fundamentals - DAGs, operators (PythonOperator, BashOperator), task dependencies, XComs
- **Day 13**: Scheduling (cron expressions), sensors, branching, error handling, retries
- **Day 14**: ADF integration with Airflow, Azure Data Factory pipelines orchestration, best practices

**Mini Project**: Create 2-3 Airflow DAGs that orchestrate your previous mini-projects (trigger ADF pipelines, monitor completion, send notifications)

***

## 🛠️ **Days 15-16: Git + CI/CD for Data Pipelines**

**Focus: Version control + automated testing basics**

- **Day 15**: Git workflows for data projects, branching strategies, .gitignore for data files, code reviews
- **Day 16**: CI/CD concepts - GitHub Actions/GitLab CI for data pipelines, automated testing (pytest for data quality), deployment patterns

**Mini Project**: Push all your code to GitHub, set up basic CI pipeline to run data quality tests

***

## 🤖 **Days 17-18: GenAI for Data Engineering + Integration**

**Focus: Practical GenAI applications in your workflow**

- **Day 17**: Using ChatGPT/Claude for generating test data, writing documentation, debugging PySpark errors, optimizing queries
- **Day 18**: **INTEGRATION DAY** - Review all mini-projects, add GenAI-generated documentation, create synthetic test datasets, refine code

**Final Project**: Build an **end-to-end data pipeline** combining everything:

1. Data ingestion from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, API)
2. PySpark transformations with data quality checks in Databricks
3. Load to cloud storage (ADLS Gen2) and Delta tables
4. Orchestrated by Airflow or Azure Data Factory
5. All code in Git with CI/CD
6. GenAI-generated documentation and test data

***

## 💣 **Daily Rules (Non-Negotiable):**

- **Code for 6-8 hours daily** - No excuses 🚫
- **Document as you learn** - Write README files for every mini-project
- **No tutorial hell** - Watch max 1-2 hour videos, spend rest CODING
- **Track your progress** - GitHub commit streak mandatory
- **Sleep 7-8 hours** - Your brain needs to consolidate this info

***

## 🎯 **80/20 Breakdown:**

**80% Time on:**

- PySpark (Days 4-7) - 4 days
- SQL + Spark SQL (Days 1-3) - 3 days
- Cloud services (Days 8-11) - 4 days

**20% Time on:**

- Airflow (Days 12-14) - 3 days
- Git/CI/CD (Days 15-16) - 2 days
- GenAI tools (Days 17-18) - 2 days

This roadmap hits **EVERY single requirement** from that job description. If you execute this properly, you won't just "get" the internship - you'll **crush** it. Now stop reading and start Day 1! ⚡💪
